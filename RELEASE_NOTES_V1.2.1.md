# Release Notes - Version 1.2.1

## Overview
This minor release focuses on bug fixes and user experience improvements, addressing UI issues and preventing article duplication in daily summaries.

## Bug Fixes

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Fixed Dashboard "View" button**: The "View" button in the Dashboard now properly switches to the "Daily Summaries" tab instead of trying to navigate to a non-existent route
- **Removed redundant test email button**: Cleaned up the Settings page by removing the test email button for a more streamlined interface
- **Improved action button layout**: Settings page now has a cleaner layout with only the essential "Save Settings" button

### Article Deduplication
- **Prevented article repetition**: Articles that have already been summarized in previous daily summaries are now automatically filtered out
- **Smart content filtering**: The system now tracks which articles have been included in summaries using the existing `article_ids` column
- **Enhanced user feedback**: Updated early return messages to clearly indicate when no new articles are found

## Technical Changes

### Database Integration
