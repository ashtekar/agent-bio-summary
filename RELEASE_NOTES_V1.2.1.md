# Release Notes - Version 1.2.1

## Overview
This minor release focuses on bug fixes and user experience improvements, addressing UI issues and preventing article duplication in daily summaries.

## Bug Fixes

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Fixed Dashboard "View" button**: The "View" button in the Dashboard now properly navigates to the summaries page instead of being non-functional
